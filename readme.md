# Portfolio

## An introduction to my short career in web development. 

Using HTML and CSS to create my first portfolio. Focusing on flexbox and media query to create a reponsive design.

- Motivated to get started as a web developer.
- I built this project to creat a starting platform to show and build a portfolio.
- Working with flexbox and media query helped to create a custom design.
- I learned from this project how to put multiple CSS rules together.
